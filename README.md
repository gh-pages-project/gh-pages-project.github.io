# GitHub Pages
GitHub pages are a static website deployed on GitHub free of charge, thanks to GitHub. The pages are used for documentation (for everything related to open source projects on GitHub) and GitHub user profiles.  In this project, we are going to learn how to create and deploy multi-repo GitHub pages under a GitHub organization, with [giscus app](https://giscus.app/) for comments. visit [project page](https://gh-pages-project.github.io/) for details.
